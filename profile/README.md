# 📜 THE IRON-CLAD DEV/OPS PACT

### 🏆 THE MOTTO
> **"We don't do things because they are easy, we do them because it's fun."**

---

### 1. THE SQUAD (The Heavyweights)
*   **Anja (The Builder):**
    *   *Primary Stats:* Full-Stack Development (Python/JS), Blockchain Logic, Electrical Engineering.
    *   *Role:* **Application Architect.** She ensures the code logic is clean, the features exist, and the electrons flow.
*   **Alex (The Scaler):**
    *   *Primary Stats:* SRE, Linux Systems, DevOps, Infrastructure.
    *   *Role:* **Infrastructure Architect.** He ensures the platform is stable, secure, and the automation is slicker than oil.

### 2. THE MISSION (Philosophy)
We do not just build projects; **we build each other.**
The goal is **Cross-Functional Hypertrophy**. By the end of the project, the Developer must think like an Admin, and the Admin must code like a Developer.

### 3. THE WORKFLOW (The "Spotter" Protocol)

#### Phase 1: The Blueprint (Design)
*   Each member is the **Head Coach** for their domain.
*   **Anja** designs *how* the app functions and data flows.
*   **Alex** designs *where* it runs and *how* it deploys.
*   *Rule:* No code is written until the other person understands the "Why."

#### Phase 2: The Pre-Workout (Preparation)
*   Before the coding session, the Head Coach prepares the material.
*   **The Constraint:** "Lean Gains Only." No 50-page PDFs. Use simple diagrams (Excalidraw/Draw.io), bullet points, or a quick pseudo-code draft.
*   If you can't explain it in 10 minutes, you are over-engineering it. Simplify the set.

#### Phase 3: The Lift (Execution via Pair Programming)
*   **The Golden Rule:** **The Student Drives, The Master Spots.**
    *   If Anja is teaching Python/Blockchain: **Alex types the code.** Anja guides his hands verbally.
    *   If Alex is teaching Docker/CI: **Anja types the YAML/Commands.** Alex explains what flags to use.
*   This ensures **Muscle Memory**. You cannot learn to lift by watching someone else bench press.

---

### 4. THE SPLIT (Cadence & Consistency)
*   **The Frequency:** Minimum 1 session per week.
*   **The Superset:** Every week must include **One Dev Task** AND **One Ops Task**.
    *   *Example:* We code the API endpoint (Dev Rep) -> We automate the test for that endpoint (Ops Rep).
*   **Balance:** We never let one skill group outpace the other. The infrastructure grows *with* the application.

---

### 5. CONFLICT RESOLUTION
*   If the code breaks: We fix it together.
*   If the server crashes: We debug it together.
*   No blaming. Only debugging.
